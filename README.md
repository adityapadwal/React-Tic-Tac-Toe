# Tic-Tac-Toe React Application

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe application built using React.js. The application allows two players to play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. It provides a clean and interactive interface to make the game enjoyable and easy to play.

Key Features
1. Components: The application is built using React.js components, which are the building blocks of a React application. Components make the code modular, maintainable, and reusable, enabling easy extension and customization of the application.

2. State Management with useState Hook: The application manages its state using the useState Hook. The state is used to keep track of the current state of the game, such as the board's status and the player's turns. When the state changes, React efficiently re-renders only the necessary components, updating the user interface.

3. Props: Data is passed between components using props. Props allow the application to pass information from parent components to child components, enabling better communication and sharing of data across the application.

4. Winning Logic: The application includes a winning logic that detects when a player has won the game. It highlights the winning squares and displays a message indicating the winner.

5. Game History: The application stores the game's history as it progresses. This allows players to review previous versions of the game's board and navigate to any move in the game's history. The history feature enhances the user experience and adds a strategic element to the game.

Apllication provides following things
1. Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
2. Indicates when a player has won the game,
3. Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
4. Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.

How to Play
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) on an empty square.
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all squares are filled and no player has three symbols in a row, the game ends in a draw.

Note: This project was made to understand and build up the working/logic of react.js and does not include any CSS styling
